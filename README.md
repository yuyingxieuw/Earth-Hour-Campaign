Organized by the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), [Earth Hour Campaign](https://www.earthhour.org/) encourages individuals, communities, and businesses worldwide to reduce energy use and raise awareness about climate change. Since its inception in Sydney in 2007, Earth Hour has grown into a global movement involving millions in over 190 countries.

Despite its popularity, the actual impact of Earth Hour on energy conservation and pro-environmental behavior remains unclear due to limited systematic evaluations (Kountouris, 2022; Olexsak & Meier, 2014). Previous research has primarily focused on social media engagement and electricity demand changes, yielding mixed results. For instance, Chan et al. (2020) found that Earth Hour effectively mobilized previously inactive individuals in Hong Kong, while Kountouris (2022) reported minimal long-term attitude shifts in Germany and the UK. Similarly, studies on electricity usage have shown varying outcomes, with some indicating significant reductions (Olexsak & Meier, 2014) and others suggesting limited energy savings (Solomon, 2008).

Critics like Chao (2020) argue that Earth Hour can impose Western environmental practices on diverse local contexts, highlighting the need for context-sensitive approaches. Olexsak and Meier (2014) stress the importance of systematic assessments to enhance the campaign's effectiveness and foster lasting environmental behaviors.

This mini study aims to evaluate the impact of Earth Hour 2024 by analyzing changes in nighttime lights using high-resolution satellite images. We will examine the spatial, socio-economic, and demographic patterns of participation to provide insights into Earth Hour’s effectiveness in promoting energy conservation across different communities.

## Method
We conduct two case studies to investigate participation in the Earth Hour event and the geographical and socio-economic characteristics of the participants. The first case study analyzes whether and how different land use types within Atlanta's neighborhoods are associated with significant changes in  NTL brightness under Earth Hour impact. The second case study examines the relationship between socio-economic and demographic factors and NTL brightness changes in Indianapolis, where we explore how variables such as income, education, and certain population correlate with participation in Earth Hour. We only present 

## Data Sources
This project utilizes high-resolution nighttime light (NTL) from the [Sustainable Development Goals Science Satellite-1 (SDGSAT-1)](https://www.sdgsat.ac.cn/) Level 4 GIU (Glimmer Imager) dataset. SDGSAT-1 provides 10 m panchromatic and 40 m RGB bands, offering superior spatial resolution and higher temporal frequency compared to traditional NTL sources like DMSP and VIIRS. We use the panchromatic bands for their enhanced detail and sensitivity to brightness variations (Wang et al., 2024).

We analyzed NTL images from Atlanta, Georgia, and Indianapolis, Indiana, captured on Earth Hour 2024 (March 23) and a baseline date (April 13). Additionally, we incorporated geospatial data (land use and city boundaries) and socio-economic/demographic data from open data sources for Atlanta and US Census datasets for Indianapolis.
